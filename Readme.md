# 3D Conway's Game of Life

3D Conway's Game of Life with Auralization powered by Unity.

## Description
 
Implemented both original and sandpile models cellular automata in three-dimensional grid with sounds associating with each cell.
We also use audio spatialization to accurately represent the actual localization of cells. Adding spatialization to sonification can be considered a kind of auralization. 

You can explore new patterns with random case and the rules defined by users. In addition to sandpile one, you can set initial position of the pile.
